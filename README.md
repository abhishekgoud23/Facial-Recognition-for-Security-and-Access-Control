# Facial Recognition for Security and Access Control

## Overview

This project aims to develop a robust facial recognition system for secure access control to military facilities and vehicles. Leveraging advanced AI technologies such as DeepFace, OpenCV, Dlib, and TensorFlow, this system ensures that only authorized personnel can access sensitive areas and equipment, thereby enhancing security.

## Introduction

The importance of secure access control in military settings cannot be overstated. This project utilizes state-of-the-art facial recognition technology to authenticate personnel, ensuring that only those with proper authorization can gain entry. This README provides an overview of the project, instructions for setting it up, and details on how to use and contribute to the project.

## Technologies Used

- **DeepFace**: A lightweight face recognition and facial attribute analysis framework for Python.
- **OpenCV**: An open-source computer vision and machine learning software library.
- **Dlib**: A toolkit for making real-world machine learning and data analysis applications.
- **TensorFlow**: An end-to-end open-source platform for machine learning.

## Installation

### Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed:

- Python 3.6 or higher
- pip (Python package installer)

### Steps

1. Clone the repository:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/facial-recognition-security.git
    cd facial-recognition-security
    ```

2. Create a virtual environment:

    ```bash
    python -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate   # On Windows, use `venv\Scripts\activate`
    ```

3. Install the required packages:

    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

4. Download the Dlib model:

    Download the `shape_predictor_68_face_landmarks.dat` file from [dlib model zoo](http://dlib.net/files/shape_predictor_68_face_landmarks.dat.bz2) and place it in the project directory.

## Usage

1. Preprocess an image:

    ```python
    from main import preprocess_image, display_image
    
    image_path = 'path_to_your_image.jpg'
    face = preprocess_image(image_path)
    if face is not None:
        display_image(face)
    ```

2. Create a database of known faces:

    ```python
    from main import create_database
    
    image_paths = ['path_to_image1.jpg', 'path_to_image2.jpg']
    names = ['Person 1', 'Person 2']
    database = create_database(image_paths, names)
    ```

3. Recognize a new face and control access:

    ```python
    from main import preprocess_image, recognize_face, access_control
    
    new_face_path = 'path_to_new_image.jpg'
    new_face = preprocess_image(new_face_path)
    if new_face is not None:
        recognized_name = recognize_face(new_face, database)
        access_control(recognized_name)
    ```

## Code Explanation

- **main.py**: This script contains the primary functions for image preprocessing, database creation, face recognition, and access control.
  - `preprocess_image(image_path)`: Reads and preprocesses an image, aligning the face.
  - `create_database(image_paths, names)`: Creates a database of known faces from given images and names.
  - `recognize_face(face, database)`: Recognizes a given face against the database.
  - `access_control(name)`: Grants or denies access based on the recognized name.
